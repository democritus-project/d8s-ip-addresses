Democritus functions<sup>[1]</sup> for working with IP addresses.

[1] Democritus functions are <i>simple, effective, modular, well-tested, and well-documented</i> Python functions.

We use `d8s` (pronounced "dee-eights") as an abbreviation for `democritus` (you can read more about this [here](https://github.com/democritus-project/roadmap#what-is-d8s)).

## Installation

```
pip install d8s-ip-addresses
```

## Usage

You import the library like:

```python
from d8s_ip_addresses import *
```

Once imported, you can use any of the functions listed below.

## Functions

  - ```python
    def ipv4_address_examples(n: int = 10):
        """Create n ipv4 addresses."""
    ```
  - ```python

  - ```python
    def ipv4_sum(ipv4_address):
        """Find the sum of the ip address by adding each section of the ip address. For example, 8.8.8.8 would sum to 32 (calculated by taking 8 + 8 + 8 + 8)"""
    ```
  - ```python
    def ipv4_is_possible_version_number(ipv4_address):
        """Determine whether or not the ipv4 ip address is likely a version number or not. This is a beta function and is a work in progress. The word "Possible" in the function name should be taken seriously; this function will return `True` if the ipv4_address *might* be a version number.
